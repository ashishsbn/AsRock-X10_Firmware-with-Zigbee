Subject: [PATCH] src/shared/ecc.c: Fix missing config.h include

The ecc.c file forgets to include <config.h>. This causes build
failures with certain C libraries, because ecc.c uses O_CLOEXEC, which
is only available when _GNU_SOURCE is defined. And _GNU_SOURCE gets
defined by <config.h>, so it should be included.
